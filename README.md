# Speed Dating analysis

This repo contains the result of me playing around with the dataset from Kaggle accessible [here](https://www.kaggle.com/annavictoria/speed-dating-experiment). The code can be run as a python notebook, and I have included several of the analytical results derived from the analysis as a pdf in this folder. 

A recommended environment to run the ipython notebook with python 3 is [jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/). Upon installing that and the packages listed in `requirements.txt` (`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`), you should be able to reproduce the code included in the notebook. For further information, consult the pdf or the ipynb.
